# config.plist highlights
- boot-args - e.g. verbose is enabled vs seeing clean mac logo and progress bar
- main iGPU platform-id
- drivers
- kexts
- boot menu "picker" settings
- boot menu tools - handy to have clear/reset nvram, toggle sip and open efi shell

# Notes / Tips
- This EFI is iGPU only (i.e. no discrete graphics card settings) which was something i couldn't readily find elsewhere but otherwise this is largely copied from these other EFI bundles i found:

- i had working hackmac already (Catalina on Clover), so preferred to download Monterey from Apple Store and install to another drive versus creating usb boot... the initial install is of course nice and cozy this way but the fun is whether the install can continue running on your EFI loader upon boot... i was freezing on apple logo progress bar a lot till i banged around on opencore configs... classic case of not sure which change really made the difference but i think AnsonLiao's EFI bundle was the closest out of the box.
- make sure you definitely do all the stuff the [opencore guide says for enabling/disabling bios settings!!](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#intel-bios-settings)

# Tools
- [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) - the safest way to edit config.plist for opencore
- [Mackie's OpenCore Configurator v2.56.00](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-opencore-configurator/) - OpenCore's docs specifically say to avoid due to creating invalid entries but it worked for me
- [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool/releases/) - good for viewing exact deviceId's and tons of other settings
- [XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) - F2 to rename and DEL to delete ðŸ’–, dual tab finders side by side
