# config.plist highlights
- boot-args - e.g. verbose is enabled vs seeing clean mac logo and progress bar
- main iGPU platform-id
- drivers
- kexts
- boot menu "picker" settings
- boot menu tools - handy to have clear/reset nvram, toggle sip and open efi shell

# Notes / Tips
- This EFI is iGPU only (i.e. no discrete graphics card settings) which was something i couldn't readily find elsewhere but this is largely copied from them
- other EFI bundles out there:

# Tools
- [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) - the safest way to edit config.plist for opencore
- [Mackie's OpenCore Configurator v2.56.00](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-opencore-configurator/) - OpenCore's docs specifically say to avoid due to creating invalid entries but it worked for me
- [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool/releases/) - good for viewing exact deviceId's and tons of other settings
- [XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) - F2 to rename and DEL to delete ðŸ’–, dual tab finders side by side
